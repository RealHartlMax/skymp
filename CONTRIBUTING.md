The only things we require is to test thoroughly, maintain code style and keeping documentation up-to-date.

Also, accepting and agreeing to release any contribution under the same license.

## Building From Source

You can find instructions on setting up the project locally below. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. You need ~4 GB RAM, ~22 GB on your hard drive and some free time.

## Prerequisites

### Common

These tools required regardless of your system:

* 64-bit [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 17.x *(may also work for older versions)*
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install): `npm install --global yarn`
* [CMake 3.19](https://cmake.org/download/) or higher

### Windows

Before your start make sure that your system meets the conditions:

* Windows 7 or higher *([Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) is recommended)*
* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). 2019 and earlier are not supported.
* .NET Framework SDK at 4.6.0 or higher *(Visual Studio Installer -> .NET desktop development)*
* Python 3.9.x 64bit or 32bit
  * Install option 1: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
  * Install option 2: Visual Studio Installer -> Individual components -> search for 'python'

### Linux

You can build and run server and unit-tests on Linux.
As Skyrim has no native Linux version, client can only be built using MSVC,
but then can be run with Proton (though some crashes can occur on SP startup
and it can be tricky to get Skyrim itself to work with non-ASCII text, for example).

* Ubuntu 22.04. Other distros are not tested or are expected to fail:
  * Alpine Linux doesn't work
  * Arch-based distros also [won't be able to run the server](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/issues/6613)
* Clang 15 *(GCC is not supported)*: `sudo apt install clang-15`
* Make sure that your NodeJS and CMake are fresh enough:
  * You can use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Nodesource's apt repositories](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) to install fresh Node
  * The simpliest way to install fresh CMake is to download a `.tar.gz` from [CMake download page](https://cmake.org/download/),
    unpack it to your home directory and add it to path:
    ```sh
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/apps/cmake-3.22.0-.../bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```
Also you can use containers to build and run server. More info can be found in the next section.

## Configuring and Building

### Common

1. Clone the repo, including submodules
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/skyrim-multiplayer/skymp.git
   cd skymp
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```

2. Do OS-specific steps (see below)

### Windows

1. Make a build directory (used for project files, cache, artifacts, etc)
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   ```
2. Generate project files with CMake (replace path with your actual Skyrim SE folder)
   ```sh
   cd build
   cmake .. -DSKYRIM_DIR="C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim Special Edition"
   ```
   For users who don't have Skyrim SE installed:
   ```sh
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
   * Some tests would be skipped
   * The server would require manual installation of Skyrim.esm and other master files
   * Papyrus scripts that require Bethesda's compiler would not be compiled, prebuilts would be used

3. Build with CMake:
   ```sh
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```
   On Windows you also can open `build/skymp.sln` with Visual Studio, then `Build -> Build Solution`.

   All build artifacts would be placed into `build/dist`.

### Linux

On Linux, there might be some tricky dependency issues. To work around them,
we recommend you to use a wrapper script `build.sh`. It will create a temporary
directory and add some aliases to `PATH`.

If you don't wish to build all the dependencies by yourself, or have an unsupported distro,
you can use [a Docker image with preinstalled dependencies](https://hub.docker.com/r/skymp/skymp-vcpkg-deps):

```sh
. misc/github_env_linux; docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD:$PWD" -w "$PWD" -u "`id -u`:`id -g`" \
    $SKYMP_VCPKG_DEPS_IMAGE bash
# ... or go rootless!
. misc/github_env_linux; podman run -it --rm -v "$PWD:$PWD" --security-opt label=disable -w "$PWD" \
    -e VCPKG_DEFAULT_BINARY_CACHE=/home/skymp/.cache/vcpkg/archives \
    $SKYMP_VCPKG_DEPS_IMAGE bash
```
`--security-opt label=disable` is used for users who have SELinux enabled and source code is located somewhere inside home directory.
Check `podman run` [documentation](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html) for more information.

1. Generate project files with CMake wrapper (replace path with your actual Skyrim SE folder)
   ```sh
   ./build.sh --configure -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
      -DSKYRIM_DIR="$HOME/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/Skyrim Special Edition"
   ```
   For users who don't have Skyrim SE installed:
   ```sh
   ./build.sh --configure -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   ```
   If you're building for a production machine, change build type to Release:
   ```sh
   ./build.sh --configure -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   ```

2. Build with CMake wrapper:
   ```sh
   cd build
   ../build.sh --build
   ```
   Additional arguments after `--build` will be passed to CMake. E.g. you can specify the build target:
   ```sh
   cd build
   ../build.sh --build --target=unit  # only build unit-tests and their dependencies
   # Will run cmake --build . --target=unit
   ```
   Also you can add `--parallel $(nproc)` to use all available CPU threads for build system

### Optional steps after build

1. Run tests:
   ```sh
   ctest -C Debug --verbose
   ```
   Some tests ([ESPMTest](https://github.com/skyrim-multiplayer/skymp/blob/main/skymp5-server/cpp/unit/EspmTest.cpp)) require Skyrim SE data files and will be skipped if you didn't specify `-DSKYRIM_DIR`.

   In order to avoid potential errors, make sure:
   1. You have installed it using Steam and it's up to date (currently last update was on [Nov 20, 2019](https://steamdb.info/depot/489832/history/?changeid=M:8702665189575304780)). See SteamDB for [hashes](https://steamdb.info/depot/489832/?show_hashes) and [update history](https://steamdb.info/depot/489832/history/).
   2. You did not modify `Skyrim.esm`, `Update.esm`, `Dawnguard.esm`, `HearthFires.esm` and `Dragonborn.esm`. (Ideally, you should have pure Vanilla version installed.)

2. Calculate test coverage (Windows-only):
   
   Install [OpenCppCoverage](https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage/OpenCppCoverage/releases) and then:
   ```sh
   cmake .. -DCPPCOV_PATH="C:\Program Files\OpenCppCoverage"
   ctest -C Debug --verbose
   ```
   These commands would re-generate project files with coverage enabled and run tests. Coverage report would be in `build/__coverage`.

## Frontend Development

The frontend code is located in `skymp5-front` directory and uses **React 18** with **TypeScript** and **Webpack**.

### Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd skymp5-front
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   Or if you prefer yarn:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

### Development Server

To run the development server with hot module reloading:
```sh
npm run watch
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).

### Building for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

Output artifacts will be placed in `skymp5-front/dist`.

### Code Style Guidelines

#### TypeScript

- Use **explicit types** for function parameters and return values
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Prefer strict-safe code (null/undefined checks, narrowings, and explicit guards)
- Avoid `any` types - use generics or proper typing instead
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed

#### React

- Use **functional components** with hooks exclusively
- Use `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` appropriately
- Prefer named functions over arrow functions for components
- Always include dependency arrays in `useEffect`

#### Formatting

- Use VS Code's `Format Document` for consistent formatting in edited files.
- **Double quotes** for strings (configured in Prettier)
- **Spaces over tabs** - 2 spaces per indent level
- **Max line length**: 100 characters (soft guideline)

#### ESLint

Lint checks are run automatically during the build process. To check locally:
```sh
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues:
```sh
npm run lint:fix
```

### Testing

The project uses automated tests to verify functionality, especially for localization and component consistency.

#### Run All Tests

```sh
npm run test
```

#### Run Specific Tests

Test for locale key consistency (ensures `en.json`, `ru.json`, `de.json` have matching structure):
```sh
npm run test:i18n
```

There is currently no dedicated `test:coverage` frontend script in `skymp5-front/package.json`.

### Localization (i18n)

The project supports multiple languages: **English (en)**, **Russian (ru)**, and **German (de)**.

Locale files are located in `src/locales/`:
- `src/locales/en.json`
- `src/locales/ru.json`
- `src/locales/de.json`

All three files must have the **same key structure**. When adding new UI strings:

1. Add the key-value pair to all three locale files with the same structure
2. Run the locale test to verify:
   ```sh
   npm run test:i18n
   ```
3. Use the key in your component:
   ```tsx
   const { t } = useTranslation();
   return <div>{t('your.locale.key')}</div>;
   ```

### TypeScript Configuration

Key settings in `skymp5-front/tsconfig.json`:
- `"resolveJsonModule": true` - Allows importing JSON files as modules
- `"ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"` - Suppresses TypeScript 6 deprecation warnings
- `"rootDir": "./src"` - Root directory for source files

## CI/CD Notes

- PR build workflows for Windows/VR/Emscripten use `.github/actions/pr_base/action.yml`.
- Discord deploy notifications are used in deploy workflows via `DEPLOY_STATUS_WEBHOOK`.
- Installer binaries are not built in this repository. Push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/trigger-installer.yml`, which sends `repository_dispatch` to the installer repository.
- Installer dispatch target is configured by repository variable `INSTALLER_REPOSITORY` (format `owner/repo`).
- Installer dispatch authentication uses repository secret `SKYMP5_INSTALLER_REPOSITORY_DISPATCH_PAT`.

## Pull Requests

- **Your branch must be buildable** - The project's build system must be able to build repo with your changes.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Give a reasonable name to your PR** - It would help to process your PR.

- **Format your C++ code** - Make sure that you format your C++ code with rules in `.clang-format`.

- **Format your TypeScript code** - For now, keep the same formatting as modified documents have (`RMB -> Format Document` in VS Code). Double quotes (" ") are used to represent a string in TypeScript code.

- **Prefer spaces over tabs** - To prevent inconsistent formatting. Applies to all languages.

- **Commit naming doesn't matter for you** - There are no strict rules in commit naming you must follow. Maintainers are responsible for fixing commit names.

- **Keep Git history clean** - Push only necessary changes. Change file paths only if necessary.

- **Remove code instead of turning it into comments** - Let Git manage history for you instead.

- **No offensive language in code** - Let's code and comment in ways that do not hurt anyone.

- **Resolve merge conflicts** - Your branch should not conflict with main branch.

## Step By Step

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some my-awesome-feature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

**Happy coding**!
